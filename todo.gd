# game loop:
	# tutorial: 
	# start with a small amount of money and a single chicken
	# you have a single order (from a friend) for a omelette 
	# you have to buy ingredients (other than eggs) 
	# craft the omelette for them
	
	# game:
	# you have word of mouth popularity that drives demand for your omelettes
	# the eggs on your plot of land are the secret ingredient that makes
	# people go crazy for them
	
	# day turn cycle:
	# you will get an amount of orders based on your popularity
	# you have to get all of the ingredients from the store for the omelettes
	# you have to collect eggs from your plot of land to use in the omelette
		# you'll be able to buy eggs but they aren't as good as your famred ones
	# you'll be able to buy more chickens, but they are expensive 
	
	# making omelette:
	# different recipes of omelette, you have to order and use the ingredients based
	#	on this recipe
	# 
	# basic omelette: 2 egg
	# medium omelette: 2 egg + cheese
	# fancy omelette: 2 egg + cheese + bacon
	#

	# farm area: 
	# you have chickens that free roam in an area 
	# they have a random chance of laying eggs
	# you have to go and collect the eggs
	#
	# chickens have a random / small chance of dropping coins
	
	# shop:
	# buy stock from the coins you've collected from the sales
	# they also sell chickens, but those cost significantly more
